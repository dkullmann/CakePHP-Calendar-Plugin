CakePHP Calendar Plugin

Contains the basic logic of a calendar with recurring events. Any modifications made to this plugin should be based on the schema for iCal and the RFC:

There is an old RFC 2445, as well.

RECURRENCE

Weekly recurrence on a particular day or a set of days is supported.

EVENTS

Repeating events and one time events are supported. You cannot have "detached" events at this time. A detached event is when one event in a series is altered and the rest of the events in that series are unaffected.

TO DO:

RECURRENCE

Include support for daily, monthly, and yearly recurrence.

EVENTS

Include support for detached events.

ATTENDEES

Include support for attendees.

ORGANIZER

Include support for organizers.
